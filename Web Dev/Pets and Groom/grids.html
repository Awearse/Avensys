                <h2>Benefits of Pet Grooming</h2>
                
                <h3>Prevents matting</h3>
                <p>When your pet sheds its fur, loose hair can get tangled and cause matting. 
                    This can be harmful to your pet if the excess fur is not brushed away.
                Additionally, the matted fur can tug on its skin, creating painful patches 
                that can lead to infection-prone sores. Thus, it is imperative that old and 
                damaged fur is removed from your pet through proper grooming.</p>
                
                <h3>Improves the appearance of your pet</h3>
                <p>Like humans, animals tend to look and feel better when they are properly 
                groomed. Regular grooming keeps your pet in the best condition, makes them 
                appear more radiant, and keeps skin problems at bay.</p>
                
                <h3>Ensures the welfare of your pet</h3>
                <p>Aside from upkeeping the appearance of your furkid, grooming allows its 
                    skin to breathe, avoiding skin irritation. In addition, it lowers the level
                     of grease in its coat.
                This is crucial because excessive amounts of grease can block pores and cause 
                discomfort.</p>

                <h2>Dog Prep</h2>
                <p>If your adult dog hasn't been to the groomer before, you might not be sure how 
                    he's going to handle the whole ordeal. Spend some time with your dog before the 
                    visit to help your dog know what to expect..

                    Adult dogs can be acclimated to the sensory overload of a groomer's shop if you 
                    start gradually and expose them to the items, smells, and sounds they will 
                    encounter during their session. Use this same method to get puppies used to loud 
                    grooming equipment.

                <h2>Cat Prep</h2>
                <p>On the day of the appointment when you tries to put the cat in the carrier, 
                    you usually face a lot of difficulties. This happens because cats do not 
                    like to be placed in a confined area and are stressed while going out as it 
                    is used to be at home, its most familiar environment most of the time. You 
                    should prepare your cat for the carrier by putting the carrier in front of the 
                    cat a few days before the groomerâ€™s appointment so that cat may sit in the 
                    carrier often and mark its scent on the carrier while wandering around the house. It will save you a lot of time and also save you from being late.</p>
