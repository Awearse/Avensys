        <h1>Competencies</h1>
        <h2>Risk Tolerance</h2>
        <p>Tend to be willing to take risks. Can also respond more quickly with less concern that things may not go as planned.</p>
        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p>Tend to learn quickly from mistakes. I may find it easy to detect patterns in your environment, allowing me to adapt my behavior and respond to feedback with ease.</p>
        <h2>Attention</h2>
        <p>I tend to be methodical in the way I complete tasks and are often thorough and restrained. I may find that I prefer to focus on accuracy over speed on tasks, and this may support me to avoid making mistakes.</p>
        <h2>Focus</h2>
        <p>I tend to apply a focused and consistent approach to my work. I are likely able to concentrate on a single task even in the presence of distracting information.</p>
        <h2>Decision Making</h2>
        <p>I tend to take time to reflect before making decisions, rather than making a decision based on gut instinct. I am also likely to be a thoughtful planner who thinks things through before reacting to a situation.</p>
